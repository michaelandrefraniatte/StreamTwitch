ffmpeg freezes while trying to stream fullscreen game

Hi,
I am trying to consider using FFMpeg for streaming as I have a pretty low-end laptop and OBS will heat it up really quickly and badly. I tried to stream GTA V, and FFMpeg works just fine with windowed mode and windowed borderless mode, however once I switch to fullscreen, it just freezes at the first frame, but audio still works.

This is the command I used:
ffmpeg -f gdigrab -s 1280x720 -framerate 15 -i desktop -f dshow -i audio="Stereo Mix (Realtek High Definition Audio)" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1280x720 -threads 0 -f flv %streamkey%

And then I tried to focus on the game window instead, but got similar results:
Command: ffmpeg -f gdigrab -s 1280x720 -framerate 15 -i title="Grand Theft Auto V" -f dshow -i audio="Stereo Mix (Realtek High Definition Audio)" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1280x720 -threads 0 -f flv %streamkey%

My specs here in case it matters:
Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 210
Processor: Intel Core i5-4460 @ 3.20GHz

ffmpeg version 2.5.2

My question: How do I fix it to not freeze after switching to full screen?

Thanks,
